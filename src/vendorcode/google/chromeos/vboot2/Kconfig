config VBOOT2_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	bool "Firmware Verification with vboot2"
	default n
	depends on CHROMEOS && HAVE_HARD_RESET
	help
	  Enabling VBOOT2_VERIFY_FIRMWARE will use vboot2 to verify the romstage
	  and boot loader.

config RETURN_FROM_VERSTAGE
	bool "return from verstage"
	default n
	depends on VBOOT2_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  If this is set, the verstage returns back to the bootblock instead of
	  exits to the romstage so that the verstage space can be reused by the
	  romstage. Useful if a ram space is too small to fit both the verstage
	  and the romstage.

config VBOOT_ROMSTAGE_INDEX
	hex
	default 2
	depends on VBOOT2_VERIFY_FIRMWARE
	help
	  This is the index of the romstage component in the verified
	  firmware block.
